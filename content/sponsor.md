# Open Source work by me

Mostly I contribute to the [Termux project](https://termux.org) both as a contributor and a maintainer reviewing PRs. For Termux, I maintain [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and also help in updating critical libraries to which a lot of packages make use of. Although lately, I expect myself to work less here and more on personal projects which I'm planning to bring up.
