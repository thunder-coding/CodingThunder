In my [Hello World](/posts/hello-world) post, I described how I set up my site, from a simple Next.js application to a blogging site. But then I realised that I spent more time in actually getting it work than on writing some real stuff, so I started feeling that I need to change this. The best way I could do this was to switch to an Open Source blogging solution. I found Hugo extremely good, and with the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/), it did wonders.

I've also opened up the source code for this site at https://github.com/thunder-coding/CodingThunder so that all the people who want to peek into the source code can do so.

Also, my exams are about to end, so I hope to get back to contribute to Open Source as soon as possible
