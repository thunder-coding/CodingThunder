Just like how programmers write a hello world program first to check the functioning of their tools. In this blog, I will be testing all the features of my blog.

# About Me

I am a student currently learning software development as a hobby with an aim to become a full time OSS contributor in the future.

## My Skills

- Git
- GitHub
- Problem Solving
- Open Source

So, if you have known enough about me let's do what this blog was written for. So let's test all features of the site.

# Blog Tests

## Code block test

```tsx
function BlogPage(props: Props) {
  return <>...</>;
}
```

`Inline` code blocks are cool too, aren't they?

# How this site was created...

## The techstack

This site is a [React](https://reactjs.org) application. Don't believe me? Oh I admit it's not plain React üòÅ

So, the secret ingrediants are... Oh wait are they really so secret? No. Anyways, here's the list of ingrediants

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [MDX (Markdown + React)](https://mdxjs.com)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)

For MDX, I am currently using [`next-mdx-remote`](https://npmjs.com/package/next-mdx-remote). Earlier I had almost set this site up with [`next-mdx-enhanced`](https://npmjs.com/package/next-mdx-enhanced), but its unmaintained now, and had some problems with latest [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), so I decided to just move away.

So that's all, that might not be so cool as other blogs but I assure you that I will add new features here soon üòâ
