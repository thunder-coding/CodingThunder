Hey there, this is to announce that now I do accept sponsorships for my open source contributions and work using Bitcoin. I mostly contribute to Termux's packaging work, porting packages and updating them. I also hope to start my own open source project soon and do some cool research.

Here's the bitcoin address: `bitcoin:bc1qg72g0znrydksyztgzfqux876hxlj2hfmfvmxcz`

I hope that I continue my open source work!
